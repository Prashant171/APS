Recursive algorithm :
  Used when there is single query and small values of n.
  Number of operations performed increases exponentially - 2^n.
  
Dynamic programming :
 Used when we have lot of queries.
 Memory efficient , less time consumed to produce output.
 Space and time are proportional to n*k.
