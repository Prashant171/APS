## Lookup table technique:
  #####    A lookup table is an array that replaces runtime computation with a simpler array indexing operation.
  #####    Processing time = n^2 
  #####    Fetch time = 1
  

## Square root decomposition technique :
#####     This technique decompose given array into small chunks specifically of size sqrt(n).
####      Number of blocks to search = √n.
####      Reduce Time Complexity by factor of √n
#####     Processing time = n
#####     Acces time = √n
