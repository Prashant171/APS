## Lookup table technique:
  ####    A lookup table is an array that replaces runtime computation with a simpler array indexing operation.
  #####    Processing time = n^2 
  #####    Fetch time = 1
  
## Square root decomposition technique :
#####     This technique decompose given array into small chunks specifically of size sqrt(n).
####      Number of blocks to search = √n.
####      Reduce Time Complexity by factor of √n
#####     Processing time = n
#####     Acces time = √n

## Segment tree technique :
#####     Segment Tree is a binary tree used for storing the intervals .
####      Time Complexity for tree construction is O(n). 
####      Time complexity to query is O(Logn).

## Kadane algorithm:
#####     It is an algorithm to solve the maximum sum subarray problem for an input array 
####      Time Complexity is O(n). 
####      It is a dynamic programming algorithm.
